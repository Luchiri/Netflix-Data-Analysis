# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project dives into Netflix’s rich collection of movies and TV shows, exploring genre diversity, content evolution, and rating patterns over time. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), it transforms raw data into visual storytelling — clean, elegant, and inspired by Netflix’s cinematic aesthetic.
